        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Achint Kaur and I am a first year student here at UCR. I just moved here from the bay area to attend this college. I am a Psychology major on a pre-health track. I am an aspiring pediatric occupational therapist. <br><br>

        For almost 2 years, I volunteered in a pediatric speech and occupational therpy clinic where I was given many oppurtunities to create session plans, games, and ideas to help any child reach their goals. I worked with kids who have autism, down syndrome, sickle cell, and were premie babies; all of these cause deveelopmental delays and can make daily life for chlidren much more difficult than it is for us. In sessions, I helped plan fine and gross moter activites, sensory regulation, dressing goals, feeding goals, and much more. I also learnt how these disorders or diseases can cause developmental delays and why it is important to correct the delays as early in the kids' childhood as early as possible. This is because kids' brains have more plasticity at a young age and are able to adapt and change much easier as compared to when they get older. Seeing the kids improve slowly but surely was so rewarding for me to see and I feel that this expereince of volunteering at the clinic really helped grow my passion for occupational therapy.<br><br>

        Additionally, I was a teaching assistant in a special education class for my junior and senior year of high school. In this class, I taught lessons on social and emotional development, grammar, vocabular, math concepts, and played many group games. I also worked one on one with students to make sure they were able to complete their assigned work. Through this, I gained a better understanding of how the minds of ids with autism works and learned how best to teach them. I learned that oftentimes they need a different approach and someitmes simply just more repitition. Though it was not alwyas easy to work with neurodivergent students, I always found it so satisfying and enjoyable to interact with them. This was one of the reasons I realized that I wanted my career to involve working with kids and I am so grateful for this experience.
